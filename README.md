Step 1.

first, download this file. https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1su1aht3HdKle8KhFdh8Hgis8iVdCS0Av&export=download&authuser=0.

Step 2.

wait for it to complete. after its completed, extract the file (recommended with 7zip or WinRAR).

Step 3.

then download Balena Etcher. especially this version because on other versions, you cannot flash the image for some reason.. https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/download/v1.18.11/balenaEtcher-Setup-1.18.11.exe.

Step 4.

then open balena etcher setup, install it, then flash the .raw image in the folder i told you to extract earlier, to your USB drive, DO NOT DO IT ON YOUR SYSTEM DRIVE!!

then unplug the USB drive, and replug the USB drive!

then done! good luck hackintoshing!

If you don't have a problematic drive like the PM981a, that i had previously, you dont need Offline Installers, but if your internet is slow, then you can use it..
